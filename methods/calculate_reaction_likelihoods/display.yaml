description : |
    <p>Reaction likelihoods represent the confidence in the inclusion of a particular reaction in a metabolic network.  The conversion of annotation likelihoods to reaction likelihoods takes into account the fact that an annotation can imply multiple functional roles, a protein with a particular functional role can be part of multiple protein complexes, and multiple complexes can catalyze the same reaction.  The likelihood of the existence of a reaction in the cell is computed as the maximum likelihood of the possible complexes that can catalyze it.  Reaction likelihoods are used to improve the gap filling of a metabolic model (see <a data-method-id=gapfill_a_metabolic_model>Gapfill Metabolic Model</a>)</p>
