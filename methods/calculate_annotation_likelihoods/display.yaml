description : |
    <p>A probabilistic annotation contains likelihoods for alternative annotations for every gene in a genome.  The calculation of likelihoods is based on similarity to genes in subsystems and genes with literature evidence.  The generated probabilistic annotation contains alternative annotations (or functional roles) for every gene along with the likelihood that the protein product of the gene possesses sequence similarity to reference proteins with the same annotation.  A probabilistic annotation is used to <a data-method-id=calculate_reaction_likelihoods>calculate reaction likelihoods</a> which can be used to improve the gap filling of a metabolic model (see <a data-method-id=gapfill_a_metabolic_model>Gapfill Metabolic Model</a>)</p>
