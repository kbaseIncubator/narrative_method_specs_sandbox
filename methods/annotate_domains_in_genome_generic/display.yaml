name     : Annotate Domains in a Genome
subtitle : |
    Annotate protein domains in a Genome object.  The Genome must already have annotated genes.  The annotation job may run for an hour or longer.  When the annotation job finishes, a DomainAnnotation object with the annotated domains will be stored in your data store.

technical-description : |
    Annotate protein domains in a Genome object.  The Genome must already have annotated genes.  The annotation job may run for an hour or longer.  When the annotation job finishes, a DomainAnnotation object will be stored in your data store. This method will find domains from one or more the following domain databases: Pfam, TIGRFAMs, COG, SMART, and NCBI CDD.
