    <p>The &quot;Build Plant Metabolic Model&quot; app generates a metabolic model for a plant. The user begins by supplying a Genome object containing protein sequences. First, the genome is annotated with PlantSEED-based metabolic annotation. Secondly, a metabolic model is generated from the metabolic annotation in the Genome object. Finally, the metabolic model is gap filled so that growth can be simulated using FBA. The user can visualize the annotated genome and the resulting metabolic model.</p>
